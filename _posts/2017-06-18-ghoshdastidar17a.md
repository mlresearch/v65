title: Two-Sample Tests for Large Random Graphs Using Network Statistics
abstract: |
  We consider a two-sample hypothesis testing problem, where the
  distributions are defined on the space of undirected graphs, and one
  has access to only one observation from each model. A motivating
  example for this problem is comparing the friendship networks on
  Facebook and LinkedIn. The practical approach to such problems is to
  compare the networks based on certain network statistics. In this
  paper, we present a general principle for two-sample hypothesis
  testing in such scenarios without making any assumption about the
  network generation process. The main contribution of the paper is a
  general formulation of the problem based on concentration of network
  statistics, and consequently, a consistent two-sample test that
  arises as the natural solution for this problem. We also show that
  the proposed test is minimax optimal for certain network statistics.
