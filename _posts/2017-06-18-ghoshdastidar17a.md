title: Two-Sample Tests for Large Random Graphs Using Network Statistics
abstract: We consider a two-sample hypothesis testing problem, where the distributions
  are defined on the space of undirected graphs, and one has access to only one observation
  from each model. A motivating example for this problem is comparing the friendship
  networks on Facebook and LinkedIn. The practical approach to such problems is to
  compare the networks based on certain network statistics. In this paper, we present
  a general principle for two-sample hypothesis testing in such scenarios without
  making any assumption about the network generation process. The main contribution
  of the paper is a general formulation of the problem based on concentration of network
  statistics, and consequently, a consistent two-sample test that arises as the natural
  solution for this problem. We also show that the proposed test is minimax optimal
  for certain network statistics.
